# CivicAlert

CivicAlert has Resident, CEPALCO, and Water District portals backed by a shared local API and SQLite database. It follows this stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend framework | React 18 |
| Programming language | TypeScript |
| Build tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| API | Express + TypeScript |
| Database | SQLite |
| Notification demonstration | Simulated SMS records and a virtual inbox |

Resident accounts and profiles, utility administrator authentication, advisories, work orders, reports, and Water District network readings use the backend. The simulated SMS inbox and Water District advisory drafts remain browser-local; no SMS is sent.

## Project structure

- `frontend/apps/` — Resident, CEPALCO, and Water District Vite applications.
- `frontend/packages/ui/` — shared React interface, Tailwind styles, local demo settings, and `localStorage` prototype data.
- `backend/apps/` — Resident, CEPALCO, and Water District API entry points.
- `backend/packages/api-core/` — shared API routes, authentication, and SQLite storage.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `tsconfig.json` — root workspace and tool configuration.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm 10 or newer

Install dependencies from the project root:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run all three portals and their APIs together:

```powershell
npm run dev:all
```

The Vite portals and APIs run at:

- Resident: `http://localhost:5173`
- CEPALCO: `http://localhost:5174`
- Water District: `http://localhost:5175`
- Resident API: `http://localhost:4101`
- CEPALCO API: `http://localhost:4102`
- Water District API: `http://localhost:4103`

Run only the APIs with `npm run dev:backend`, or launch an individual API with `npm run dev:api:resident`, `npm run dev:api:cepalco`, or `npm run dev:api:water`. The API processes share `backend/data/civicalert.sqlite` by default.

You can run one portal instead:

```powershell
npm run dev:resident
npm run dev:cepalco
npm run dev:water
```

## Demo accounts and data

CEPALCO and Water District demo administrator accounts use the password `DemoPass123!`:

| Portal | Username |
|---|---|
| CEPALCO | `admin@cepalco.local` |
| Water District | `admin@waterdistrict.local` |

Residents can register from the Resident portal. Resident accounts, profiles, advisories, work orders, reports, and network readings are stored in the shared backend database. Virtual-inbox messages and Water District advisory drafts remain in this browser's `localStorage`.

In development, CEPALCO and Water District demo administrators use the password `DemoPass123!` from the accounts above. Demo accounts are seeded when the API starts outside production. In production, configure administrator accounts separately; development seed accounts are not created.

Set these optional Vite environment variables to point each portal at a different API host:

```text
VITE_RESIDENT_API_URL=http://localhost:4101
VITE_CEPALCO_API_URL=http://localhost:4102
VITE_WATER_API_URL=http://localhost:4103
```

The APIs accept `RESIDENT_API_PORT`, `CEPALCO_API_PORT`, and `WATER_API_PORT` to override their individual listen ports (`PORT` remains a fallback when running one API by itself), `DATABASE_PATH` to configure the SQLite file, and `CORS_ORIGIN` as a comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins. If changing the database location, give all three API processes the same `DATABASE_PATH`.

Advisories are stored centrally. A resident can list advisories; CEPALCO and Water District administrators must authenticate against their respective API, and the server restricts advisory creation, listing, and status changes to that administrator's utility. Login tokens are stored in browser local storage to preserve portal sessions.

The **Virtual SMS inbox** remains a demonstration feature: its records are browser-local and no SMS is sent. Clearing site local storage clears those demo records and drafts, but does not delete backend accounts or advisories.

## Gmail advisory notifications

An advisory is saved even if email delivery cannot complete. After publishing, the utility portal shows how many opted-in resident emails were sent or failed. Per-recipient results are stored in SQLite. An authorized administrator can retry failed deliveries after reconnecting Gmail; residents who have since opted out are excluded from a retry.

Only residents who explicitly select **Immediate advisory emails** during registration or in their profile are recipients. The checkbox is off by default, including for existing accounts migrated to the new database column. It is independent of **Email Advisory Digest**; the weekly digest preference does not enable immediate alerts. Each recipient receives a separate message containing the advisory title, affected area, full public details, and reference.

Before enabling real delivery, an administrator must complete this one-time setup:

1. In Google Cloud Console, create/select a project, enable the Gmail API, and configure the OAuth consent screen. Add the utility sending accounts as test users if the consent screen is in Testing; publish/verify the consent screen as required for the intended deployment.
2. Create a **Web application** OAuth client. Register the exact callback URLs as authorized redirect URIs:
   - Local CEPALCO: `http://localhost:4102/oauth/gmail/callback`
   - Local Water District: `http://localhost:4103/oauth/gmail/callback`
   - Production: the corresponding HTTPS API callback URL for each utility.
3. Provide the following settings to the backend processes using the host's secret/environment configuration. Do not put values in frontend `VITE_*` variables, TypeScript, or source control:
   - `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — a randomly generated, base64-encoded 32-byte key. Keep it stable and backed up securely; losing/changing it requires administrators to reconnect Gmail.
   - `CEPALCO_GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL` and `WATER_GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL` — exact official sending addresses, used to reject authorization of another Google account.
   - `GMAIL_CEPALCO_REDIRECT_URI` and `GMAIL_WATER_REDIRECT_URI` when the defaults above do not apply.
   - `CEPALCO_FRONTEND_URL` and `WATER_FRONTEND_URL` if the admin portals use non-default URLs; production URLs must use HTTPS.
4. Start the APIs with those settings present in their environment. Sign in as the matching utility administrator and use **Connect Gmail** on its publish-advisory screen. Google consent is requested for Gmail send access (`gmail.send`) plus `openid`/`email` only to verify that the connected account matches the configured official address.

Refresh tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before they are stored in SQLite. They, OAuth client secrets, and the encryption key are never returned to the frontend. If Gmail is not configured, not connected, revoked, or rejects a message, the advisory remains published and the delivery result reports failure instead of claiming an email was sent. The utility admin can inspect `GET /advisories/:id/email-delivery` and retry failed recipients with `POST /advisories/:id/email-delivery/retry` on that utility's API.

**Live email delivery has not been verified in this environment.** It requires the Google Cloud setup above, an authorized official Gmail account connected by a utility administrator, and at least one real resident who explicitly opted in. Tests exercise OAuth scope construction, token encryption, message formatting, opt-in filtering, and failure reporting without sending real email.
